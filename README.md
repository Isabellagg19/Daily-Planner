# Daily-Planner
This is my third project for the Athena Award, called My Daily Planner. I designed this website especially for girls who sometimes struggle to find motivation while studying. My goal was to create a space that feels positive, cozy, and inspiring, a place that reminds you to keep working hard for the things you want to achieve. I built the entire project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On this page, users can write down their daily goals, use a Pomodoro timer that helps them stay focused for 25 minutes and rest for 5, and keep a personal journal to write their thoughts, reflections, and small wins. There’s also a motivation section with quotes from inspiring women to give that extra boost of confidence when it’s most needed.

I created this project based on how I would want to study, surrounded by motivation, calm colors, and words that keep me going. My Daily Planner is meant to help anyone who needs encouragement to stay focused, stay positive, and keep believing in their goals.
